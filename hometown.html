            <p>Hello I'm Erica Yanong Dabalos! I hope you like my website. It's my second time to make this kind of project actually. I'm a BSIT first year student.
               It is really one of my dream to be a Software Engineer or a Web Developer. My goal is to create, innovate and advance the technology. Now that you know me, I will
               also introduce to you about my beloved hometown, where people are hardworking and generous, the Pinamungajan Cebu. It nestled in the southwestern part of Cebu province in the Philippines. Located on the western coast of Cebu Island, facing the Ta√±on Strait, it's approximately 60 kilometers southwest of Cebu City, the bustling provincial capital.

                I take pride in the scenic beauty of Pinamungajan, with its rolling hills, lush forests, and breathtaking coastal areas. There's something truly special about the stunning views of the sea and the serene countryside that surrounds us.
                
                Our municipality has a rich agricultural heritage, and I'm grateful for the fertile lands that support a variety of crops, including rice, corn, sugarcane, and an abundance of fruits and vegetables. As I travel through the rural landscape, I'm always struck by the sight of farms and plantations thriving under the sun.
                
                Pinamungajan isn't just about natural beauty; we also have several tourist attractions that showcase our heritage. From the adventurous Aloguinsan River Eco-cultural Tour to the tranquil Hermit's Cove and the serene Pinamungajan Nature Park, there's no shortage of places to explore and enjoy.
                
                Our cultural and historical sites add depth to our identity. I love visiting old churches like the San Miguel Arcangel Parish Church, which carries stories from our Spanish colonial past.
                
                Of course, no visit to Pinamungajan is complete without indulging in our local cuisine. From mouthwatering seafood dishes to traditional Filipino fare and unique regional delicacies, there's always something delicious to savor here.
                
                Pinamungajan holds a special place in my heart, offering a harmonious blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and warm hospitality that makes it truly unforgettable.  </p>
